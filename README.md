# n+7
Many years ago (I think it was in 2001) I participated in a class about *Mathematics & Literature*. Beside others the "n+7 method" was presented: You replace in a text each noun with the noun in a dictionary which is 7 places after the original noun, e.g., "a man meets a woman" is transformed to "a mandrake meets a wonder" using the Langenscheidt dictionary.  

This repository contains the files I submitted to the [Algorithmia Shorties Contest](http://blog.algorithmia.com/2015/12/the-algorithmia-shorties-contest/).

A few comments:
* the original list of nouns is from http://www.desiquintans.com/nounlist (downloaded on Dec 21s, 2015); I like the idea of a simple list with only the most commonly used but added anyway a few words
